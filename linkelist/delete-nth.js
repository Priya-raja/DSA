// Nth node from the end of a Linked List using two pointers:
// As Nth node from the end equals to (Length â€“ N + 1)th node from the start, so the idea is to Maintain two pointers starting from
// the head of the Linked-List and move one pointer to the Nth node from the start and then move both the pointers together until
// the pointer at the Nth position reaches the last node. Now the pointer which was moved later points at the Nth node from the 
// end of the Linked-List
//NAive approach.. calculate length then use (len-n+1) loop and remove.
//Smart Two pointer
